Event Management and Catering
================
This module provides a comprehensive Event Management system—distinct from
Odoo’s default event module—that allows users to manage various types of
events and assign services to different users. It includes built-in support
for catering, enabling organizers to handle catering needs directly within
the event workflow. The module is designed to be extensible, allowing
additional services to be integrated seamlessly in the future. With the
Catering service now embedded, users can manage all aspects of event planning,
including service allocation, from a single, unified interface.
